# Defect-Detection
This code uses OpenCV and NumPy for image analysis, detecting changes, color variations, angle shifts, rust, and objects using YOLO. It preprocesses images, compares them for differences, detects rust based on color, and identifies objects with YOLO, displaying results visually for easy interpretation.
