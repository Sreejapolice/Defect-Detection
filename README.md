# Defect-Detection
This code uses OpenCV and NumPy for image analysis, detecting changes, color variations, angle shifts, rust, and objects using YOLO. It preprocesses images, compares them for differences, detects rust based on color, and identifies objects with YOLO, displaying results visually for easy interpretation.



# note
I have provided the files to be installed for object recognisation they are coco.names , yolov3 and other one is yolov3.weights which in large size so try to download it.
